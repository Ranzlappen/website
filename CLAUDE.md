# ranzlappen.com

Personal blog + PolyVote community voting platform + Blog Admin dashboard + Inventory Manager, hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Architecture

**Hybrid project** with four independent builds:

- **Jekyll blog** (root) — Static site built by GitHub Pages. Posts in `_posts/`, layouts in `_layouts/`, includes in `_includes/`, pages in `pages/`. Config: `_config.yml`.
- **PolyVote** (`polyvote/`) — React 19 SPA built with Vite. Backend: Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Cloud Functions). Deployed as a subfolder within the Jekyll `_site/`.
- **Blog Admin** (`blog-admin/`) — React 19 SPA built with Vite for managing blog drafts and publishing. Uses Firebase (Firestore, Auth), CodeMirror 6 for Markdown editing, and Zustand for state. Deployed as a subfolder within the Jekyll `_site/`.
- **Inventory Manager** (`inventory-manager/`) — React 19 SPA built with Vite for managing inventory with folders, custom per-folder field schemas, photos in Firebase Storage, CSV/JSON import-export, and eBay File Exchange CSV export. Admin-only via Firebase Auth custom claim (same login as Blog Admin). Hidden from crawlers (robots.txt `Disallow: /inventory/` + `noindex` meta tags + not listed in nav). Deployed as a subfolder within the Jekyll `_site/` at `/inventory/`. **See [`inventory-manager/README.md`](./inventory-manager/README.md) for the architecture handbook** (data model, persistence, eBay export format, how to add field types or functions).

## Build & Development

### Blog (Jekyll)
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve          # Local dev server at :4000
```

### PolyVote (React/Vite)
```bash
cd polyvote
npm install                       # Install dependencies
npm run dev                       # Local dev server at :5173
npm run build                     # Production build (tsc + vite build)
npm run lint                      # ESLint (flat config)
npm test                          # Vitest (unit tests)
npm run format                    # Prettier formatting
```

### Blog Admin (React/Vite)
```bash
cd blog-admin
npm install                       # Install dependencies
npm run dev                       # Local dev server
npm run build                     # Production build (tsc + vite build)

```

### Cloud Functions
```bash
cd polyvote/functions
npm install
npm run build                     # Compile TypeScript
npm run lint                      # tsc --noEmit
npm test                          # Vitest (unit tests)
```

Production deploys of `castBlogVote`, the Blog Admin callables (`blogSaveDraft`, `blogListDrafts`, `blogGetDraft`, `blogDeleteDraft`, `blogListExistingPosts`, `blogFetchExistingPost`, `blogImportPostForEdit`, `blogPublishToGitHub`, `blogUploadImage`, `blogListSeriesUsage`), the admin user-management callables shared with the Blog Admin Users panel (`setUserRole`, `adminListUsers`, `adminBanUser`, `adminUnbanUser`), and the Inventory Manager callables (`inventoryListFolders`, `inventoryCreateFolder`, `inventoryUpdateFolder`, `inventoryDeleteFolder`, `inventoryDuplicateFolder`, `inventoryListItems`, `inventoryGetItem`, `inventoryCreateItem`, `inventoryUpdateItem`, `inventoryDeleteItem`, `inventoryToggleEbaySync`, `inventoryUploadPhoto`, `inventoryDeletePhoto`, `inventoryReorderPhotos`, `inventoryImport`, `inventoryExport`, `inventoryExportEbayCsv`) are automated (see CI/CD below). Manual deploys of anything else use `firebase deploy --only functions:<name>` from `polyvote/`.

## Key Conventions

- **Module boundaries**: `polyvote/`, `blog-admin/`, `inventory-manager/`, and the Jekyll root (blog) are four independent modules, with `polyvote/functions/` as a fifth nested module. Each has its own `package.json`/`Gemfile`, TypeScript/ESLint/Tailwind config, and deploy path. Run install/lint/test/build/format from within the module's own directory (see **Build & Development**). Do **not** cross-import source between modules — there is no monorepo tooling and no shared package. If logic truly needs to be shared, duplicate it intentionally (e.g. `polyvote/functions/src/inventory/shared.ts` is mirrored in `inventory-manager/src/types.ts`). Scope PRs to a single module when possible so CI's per-app path filters stay meaningful.
- **Post status**: Posts use a `status` field in front matter (`published`, `draft`, `placeholder`, `unpublished`). Only `published` and `placeholder` appear in the sitemap and feed.
- **Post categories**: Posts set a singular `category:` field in front matter. The string `"Projects"` (capitalized, exact match) is canonical and routes the post to `/projects/`; everything else lands on `/blog/`. Homepage and `/categories/` show all categories. Liquid's `==` is case-sensitive — keep the exact casing.
- **Navigation**: Centralized in `_data/pages.yml` — single source of truth for nav and footer links. Reference pages are reached via the top-nav **References** entry, which routes to `/references/` — a hand-rolled index page (`pages/references/index.html`) that lists Spectrum, Electronics Fundamentals, and the CLI Cheat Sheet as cards. Don't add individual reference URLs to `_data/pages.yml`; add a new card to the index page instead.
- **Abbreviations / glossary**: Reference pages share one utility for term cards + click-to-explain modal + opt-in in-content decoration. Per-page YAML datasets live under `_data/abbreviations/<page>.yml`; markup is `_includes/abbreviations-section.html`; styles `/assets/css/abbreviations.css`; behaviour `/assets/js/abbreviations.js`. To add it to a page: include the partial with `data=site.data.abbreviations.<page>`, pull in the CSS+JS, and add `data-abbr-decorate` to any element whose text should auto-link matched terms. Per-page datasets are isolated, so the same key can have different definitions on different pages with no collision. Entry schema: `term` + `full_form` + `explanation` (required) plus optional `plain` (beginner-first prose), `example` (shell/code snippet rendered as `<pre><code>` in the modal — string or array; literal text, not HTML), and `interpretation` (structured table with `title`/`columns`/`rows`/`footnote`). All optional fields are additive — existing entries without them render identically.
- **Reference-table scaffolding**: The sticky tab strip + live-search + scrollable big-table pattern used by `/references/spectrum/` and `/references/cmd-cheat-sheet/` is shared. Styles live in `/assets/css/reference-table.css` (controls, tabs, search, sticky thead, `.is-sticky-col` hook for the pinned column, generic legend swatches, `.reference-badge` base, the `.cell-collapse` family). Behaviour lives in `/assets/js/reference-table.js` and exposes one function — `window.initReferenceTable({tableId, tabSelector, searchId, countId, emptyId, blurbId, batchDataId})` — that each page's thin wrapper calls with its own IDs. Per-page CSS files (`spectrum.css`, `cmd-cheat-sheet.css`) layer column widths and palette modifiers on top, scoped under `.reference-page--<slug>` so overrides cannot leak between pages. To add a third reference page: opt in via `<section class="reference-page reference-page--<slug>">`, load the shared CSS/JS before the per-page ones, and write a thin wrapper that calls `initReferenceTable`.
- **cmd-widgets (Interactive Tools section on the CLI cheat sheet)**: Four browser-only widgets — chmod calculator, find builder, regex tester, curl composer — live on `/references/cmd-cheat-sheet/`. JS lives in `/assets/js/cmd-widget-core.js` (registry + `CMDW.mountAll()` + `CMDW.copyToClipboard()` + `CMDW.shellEscape()` + `CMDW.makeOutput()`/`CMDW.el()` helpers) and four `cmd-widget-<name>.js` files that each call `CMDW.register('<name>', factory)`. The entry point `cmd-widget-bundle.js` calls `mountAll()` on DOMContentLoaded; the loader scans for `<section data-cmd-widget="<name>">` and invokes the matching factory. Styles in `/assets/css/cmd-widgets.css`. Adding a fifth widget: create `cmd-widget-<name>.js`, drop a `<section data-cmd-widget="<name>">` on the page, add the script tag, optionally hook a `see_also: ["widget-<name>"]` entry from a cmd row (the see-also renderer in `cmd-cheat-sheet.html` routes `widget-*` slugs to `#widget-<name>` instead of `#cmd-<slug>`). Per CLAUDE.md's "duplicate intentionally" rule, the widget core deliberately mirrors EF's pattern rather than importing it — they're independent.
- **External apps**: The user's external apps (standalone subdomains like `ticked.ranzlappen.com`) are **not** in the navbar. They're listed in `_data/projects.yml` and rendered as a favicon strip in the footer via `_includes/footer.html`. Favicons are committed locally under `assets/images/favicons/` — **do not hotlink** upstream favicons (privacy-first: hotlinking leaks visitor IP/UA to the subdomain on every page load, before consent). To refresh a favicon, `curl` the upstream `<link rel="icon">` target into `assets/images/favicons/<name>.png` and commit.
- **Firebase keys**: Public client-side keys in `_config.yml`, `polyvote/src/firebase.ts`, `blog-admin/src/firebase.ts`, and `inventory-manager/src/firebase.ts`. Security is enforced via Firestore rules, Storage rules, and Cloud Functions.
- **Server-validated writes**: All client writes go through Cloud Functions (`httpsCallable`), never direct Firestore SDK writes. This applies to PolyVote user actions (votes, comments, requests), Blog Admin operations (drafts, publishing), **and** Inventory Manager operations (folders, items, photos, import/export, eBay CSV). Keep `blog-admin/src/firebase.ts` and `inventory-manager/src/firebase.ts` free of `addDoc`/`setDoc`/`updateDoc`/`deleteDoc`.
- **Inventory Manager hiding**: The tool lives at `/inventory/` and must stay invisible to crawlers. Three layers guard this: `robots.txt` carries `Disallow: /inventory/`; the SPA's `index.html` ships `<meta name="robots" content="noindex,nofollow,noarchive,nosnippet">`; nothing in `_data/pages.yml` or `_data/projects.yml` links to it. Do **not** add it to nav, footer, or any public-facing page.
- **Inventory Storage**: Photos go to Firebase Storage bucket `proven-concept-436717-q3.firebasestorage.app` (the new-style bucket — not the legacy `.appspot.com`) at `inventory/{itemId}/{uuid}.{ext}` and are made public-read so eBay's `PicURL` field can fetch them. The bucket name is pinned in `polyvote/functions/src/inventory/photos.ts` (`INVENTORY_BUCKET` constant) and in `inventory-manager/src/firebase.ts` (`storageBucket`). Storage rules in `polyvote/storage.rules` block all client writes; uploads only happen via the `inventoryUploadPhoto` Cloud Function (admin SDK bypasses rules). Firebase Storage must be enabled in the Firebase Console for this to work — one-time manual setup.
- **Blog import flow**: Importing an existing `_posts/` file from Blog Admin offers two explicit modes — **Edit** (links the draft to the GitHub file via `blogDrafts.sourceFilename`, so re-imports reopen the same draft and publish updates in place) and **Copy** (unlinked draft seeded with a `-copy` slug for creating a new post). `blogPublishToGitHub` requires `confirmOverwrite: true` when a draft would silently overwrite an unlinked GitHub file.
- **Privacy-first**: No Google Analytics. Cookie consent is GDPR-compliant with functional category.
- **Theme**: Dark mode is default across all four modules. The blog and reference pages (Spectrum, Electronics Fundamentals) share one dark/light toggle driven by CSS custom properties on `<html data-theme>`. PolyVote uses Tailwind + CSS variables persisted via Zustand/localStorage. Blog Admin and Inventory Manager are dark-only by design — no theme toggle, no `.light` CSS variant.

## Deployment & CI/CD

Six GitHub Actions workflows live in `.github/workflows/`. The four auto-trigger workflows are each scoped with `paths` / `paths-ignore` filters so they only fire when their inputs change; the other two are manual-trigger-capable.

| Workflow | Trigger | Scope | Deploys |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ci.yml` | PR → `main` | Per-app jobs gated by `dorny/paths-filter` — only changed apps run lint/test/build. | Nothing (validation only). |
| `jekyll-gh-pages.yml` | Push → `main` | Skips docs, Firebase configs, Cloud Functions, and Firestore/RTDB/Storage rules. | Full site to GitHub Pages (Jekyll + PolyVote + Blog Admin + Inventory Manager). |
| `feature-preview.yml` | Push → `test` + manual `workflow_dispatch` (with optional `ref` input, defaults to `test`) | Same `paths-ignore` as `jekyll-gh-pages.yml`. | Combined GitHub Pages artifact: main rebuilt at root (Jekyll + PolyVote + Blog Admin + Inventory Manager, identical to `jekyll-gh-pages.yml`'s output) plus the `test` branch (or dispatch `ref`) rebuilt **Jekyll-only** under `/test/` via `bundle exec jekyll build --baseurl /test`. Preview URL: `https://www.ranzlappen.com/test/` (custom domain serves the artifact root, no `/<repo>/` prefix). Shares the `pages` concurrency group with `jekyll-gh-pages.yml` so the two queue, never overlap. |
| `firebase-deploy.yml` | Push → `main` (Firebase/Functions paths) + manual | Builds Cloud Functions, then deploys. | Firestore rules + indexes, RTDB rules, Storage rules, `castBlogVote`, all Blog Admin callables, admin user-management callables (`setUserRole`, `adminListUsers`, `adminBanUser`, `adminUnbanUser`), and all Inventory Manager callables (`inventory*`). |
| `firebase-deploy-manual.yml` | Manual only (`workflow_dispatch`) | Accepts a `target` input passed straight to `firebase deploy --only`. Default `functions` redeploys every function in `polyvote/functions/src/index.ts` — future-proof for newly added functions. Shares the `firebase-deploy` concurrency group with the auto-deploy. | Whatever the `target` input specifies (default: all Cloud Functions). |

**Preview limitations**: `feature-preview.yml` ships **Jekyll-only** under `/test/`. PolyVote, Blog Admin, and Inventory Manager are not rebuilt at the preview subpath because their Vite `base` and React Router `basename` are hardcoded to `/polyvote/`, `/blog-admin/`, and `/inventory/`. Navbar links to those apps will 404 inside the preview tree. To enable SPA previews later, make `base` env-driven in `polyvote/vite.config.ts`, `blog-admin/vite.config.ts`, `inventory-manager/vite.config.ts`, the three `main.tsx` files, PolyVote's `ShareButton.tsx`, and PolyVote's PWA manifest (defaults preserve current paths exactly).

**What fires on a given change:**

| Change | CI (on PR to `main`) | Pages prod (push → `main`) | Pages preview (push → `test`) | Firebase (push → `main`) |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Blog post / Jekyll page | — | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| `polyvote/src/**` | polyvote | ✓ | ✓ (rebuilt from main only) | — |
| `blog-admin/src/**` | blog-admin | ✓ | ✓ (rebuilt from main only) | — |
| `inventory-manager/src/**` | inventory-manager | ✓ | ✓ (rebuilt from main only) | — |
| `polyvote/functions/**` | functions | — | — | ✓ |
| `firestore.rules` / `firestore.indexes.json` | — | — | — | ✓ |
| `database.rules.json` / `storage.rules` | — | — | — | ✓ |
| `CLAUDE.md` / `README.md` / `LICENSE` | — | — | — | — |

**Concurrency**: CI cancels superseded runs per PR branch. Pages deploys (both `jekyll-gh-pages.yml` and `feature-preview.yml`) and Firebase deploys **queue** (no cancel) to avoid half-applied state.

**Node version**: All JS jobs (CI + Pages build) run on Node 22.

**Required secret**: `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` (JSON service-account key) for `firebase-deploy.yml`.

**Dependabot** (`.github/dependabot.yml`): weekly updates for all four npm packages (polyvote, polyvote/functions, blog-admin, inventory-manager), bundler, and GitHub Actions. Minor+patch are grouped. Each PR runs CI — `ci.yml` triggers on every PR to `main` (no `paths:` filter) so the `ci-required` aggregator always appears as a status check.

**Auto-merge** (`.github/workflows/dependabot-auto-merge.yml`): every Dependabot PR is queued for GitHub native auto-merge (`gh pr merge --auto --merge`) and lands once required status checks pass. **Requires branch protection on `main` to mark `ci-required` as a required status check** — without that, `--auto` merges immediately without waiting and a failing CI won't block the merge (this happened with PR #236, a `firebase-admin` v12→v13 major bump whose `functions` job failed but landed anyway because no required check was configured). `ci-required` is a single aggregator job in `ci.yml` that succeeds only when every conditional app job (`polyvote`, `functions`, `blog-admin`, `inventory-manager`) either passed or was skipped via path filter; mark it required and the conditional-job deadlock problem disappears.

**Manual fallbacks**:
- Trigger `firebase-deploy-manual.yml` via `workflow_dispatch` (preferred) — deploys via GitHub Actions using the shared service-account secret. Default target is `functions` (all Cloud Functions); override with any `--only` target, e.g. `functions:blogSaveDraft,functions:blogPublishToGitHub` or `functions,database,firestore`.
- Or, from `polyvote/` authenticated via `firebase login`:
  - `firebase deploy --only firestore` — rules + indexes
  - `firebase deploy --only functions:<name>` — a specific function
- Re-run Pages: trigger `jekyll-gh-pages.yml` via `workflow_dispatch`

## Post-task self-check

After every turn that produces a branch, PR, feature, or bug fix, do a quick self-check before replying: does the change introduce anything worth codifying in docs or automation? Scan for new env vars, npm scripts, path filters, deploy targets, secrets, setup steps, dependencies, or conventions that should be reflected in `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.github/workflows/*.yml`, or `.github/dependabot.yml`.

Decide per case:

- **Auto-implement** small, unambiguous updates — e.g. noting a newly introduced env var in README, extending a workflow `paths` filter to a new directory, adding a new npm script to the relevant command list, bumping a Node version already changed in one workflow to match the others. Make the edit in the same turn and call it out in the summary.
- **Prompt first** for anything ambiguous, opinionated, or structurally significant — rewriting a README section, adding a new top-level doc, restructuring a workflow, or changes whose wording/location isn't obvious.

If nothing is warranted, say "no doc/workflow updates needed" in one line. Skip this self-check entirely for pure Q&A turns that don't change code.
